# Test mkdocs documentaation
mkdocs is a simple way to create static documentation website  
that is based on Markdown files.

A theme that I find is looking good is [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/)  

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).   
To view this site use [https://youdar.github.io/test_mkdocs.io/](https://youdar.github.io/test_mkdocs.io/)
